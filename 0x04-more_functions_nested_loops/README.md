This project is an extension of Functions and nested loops. There are 12 tasks in this project:

0. isupper
This functions checks for uppercase characters

1. isdigit
This function checks for a digit (0 to 9).

2. Collaboration is multiplication
In this task requires a function that multiplies two integers. Its prototype is int mul(int a, int b)

3. The numbers speak for themselves
In this task I wrote a function that prints the numbers 0 to 9, followed by a new line. The function prototype is: void print_numbers(void);

4. I believe in numbers and signs
In this task I wrote a function that prints the numbers 0 to 9 apart fromthe numbers 2 and 4, followed by a new line. The function prototype: void print_most_numbers(void);

5. Numbers constitute the only universal language
This task requires a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a newline. Function prototype: void more_numbers(void);
