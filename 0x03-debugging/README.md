This project is on debugging. It has four tasks:
-> 0. Multiple mains: The task  is to test whether the positive_or_negative() function gives the correct output when given a case of zero.

-> 1. Like, comment, subscribe: The task here is to comment out the part of the code that is causeing the output to go into an infinite loop.

-> 2. 0 > 972?: The task here is to fix the code in the file 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

-> 3. Leap year: The task here is to fix the function print_remaining_days() so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
